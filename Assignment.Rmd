```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library('tidyverse')
raw_dat = ISLR::Auto
dat = raw_dat %>%
  select(year, mpg, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration)
```

You have all of the other information listed in the `dat` variable. Assume the data is accurate and clean.
```{r}
head(dat)
```


Use logistic regression via the `glm()` function, to predict whether the car should be classified as being made (`year`) on or before 1977. 

Show any work leading up to your decision. Please describe the following:  

  - How you selected your test/train split
  - What process you used for variable selection
  - Why you selected the specific probability threshold
  - How the base rate fallacy does or does not apply in this case
  - What you infer from the results
  - What issues might be present that you haven't accounted for
  
```{r}
